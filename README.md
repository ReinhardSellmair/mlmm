# MLMM

This repo contains code to explore ML retraining strategies.

All required libraries to run the code are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 

The code in the `src` directory is organized as follows:
- `analysis.py`: analyse training data
- `feature_generation.py`: syntezise training data  
- `model_tuning.py`: excute and evaluate different re-training strategies

The `combined.ipynb` notebook in `notebooks` contains all the analysis I used for my article.
